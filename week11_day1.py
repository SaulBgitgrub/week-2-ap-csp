print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Saul"
age = 15
favorite_color = "Green"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My first name is " + (first_name) + " and my favorite color is " + (favorite_color))
print(f"{first_name} and {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1 = 7
num2 = 5
num3 = int(input("What is your 3rd favorite: "))
num4 = int(input("What is your 4th favorite: "))
print(num1 + num2) #output 12
print(num3 + num4) #output

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
